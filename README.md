I saw [other developers doing AMAs](https://github.com/sindresorhus/amas), and I figured why not! I also wanted to add a little more transparency to my online presence. So ask me anything, and I'll do my answer it in a timely fashion.

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.
